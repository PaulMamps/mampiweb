  h3 Content Management
  p We worked with the Chicago Food Magazine team to outline the features and content specifications that would be required to build a publishing platform that would meet their early stage and future goals. Since the publication was just in its early stage, it was crucial to develop a platform that would scale for future needs. As a result, [Craft CMS](https://buildwithcraft.com/) was chosen as the content management system.

  p With Craft, we were able to develop a variety modular elements that could be added to each article on the responsive website. This allows the team plenty of versatility in their posting and keeps each article interesting. Articles can be augmented with quotes, videos, inline photography, galleries and social media elements. Additionally, contributors are able to see a live preview of how their content will appear while they are creating it.

Additionally, the online publication allows for marketers and those in public relations to create accounts and publish directly to the “Fresh News & Events Feed”. This provides Chicago Food Magazine with any extra channel from breaking content.
