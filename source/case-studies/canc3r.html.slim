  p A cancer survivor all to familiar with the financial burden of treatment, Jeremy Picker founded CANC3R as a way to use his knowledge of the apparel industry to raise funds for those fighting the disease. Proceeds from the sale of a line of hip tee shirts featuring positive messages go directly toward a patient fighting cancer.

  p To support this great cause, LaCroix Design Co. donated our services to create a brand identity for CANC3R. The logo needed to have a modern, youthful aesthetic to compliment the apparel line while also showcasing the unique spelling of the brand. Additionally, the wordmark was designed to have a strong presence to represent the strength of the patients fighting cancer.

  p CANC3R needed a bright, visual website that clearly delivered their message and showcased their product. Taking advantage of our <a href="http://www.1PageSites.com" target="_blank">1 Page Sites</a> service, CANC3R was able to quickly launch a site to begin raising money for their first campaign.
