Last year we had the privilege to work with entrepreneurs Zofia Wosinska and Jeremy Picker to design a  [brand identity](http://www.lacroixdesign.net/case-studies/estaine/) and [responsive website](http://www.lacroixdesign.net/case-studies/estaine/) for their new venture, ÉSTAINE. Now they are in the process of utilizing [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/146567895/estaine-science-fashion-impact-shop-smart-fight-ca) as a platform to launch their first line of luxury accessories.

ÉSTAINE  is using high fashion as a medium to fight cancer. Their Italian-made silk pocket squares, scarves and ties feature the colors and patterns of dyes used in cancer diagnosis. Beyond fashion, these products are intended to educate the community and aid those who are battling cancer. The unique designs are birthed in scientific research yet tell the stories of cancer survivors.

With 14 days remaining, ÉSTAINE  has already received pledges for over 70% of their goal. However, the project will not be funded unless they receive at least $20,000 in total pledges. Thus, we encourage you to consider supporting their [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/146567895/estaine-science-fashion-impact-shop-smart-fight-ca) or visiting the [ÉSTAINE website](http://www.estaine.com/) website to learn more. We are excited see everything that ÉSTAINE has in store and thrilled to have been a part of helping them launch their business.
