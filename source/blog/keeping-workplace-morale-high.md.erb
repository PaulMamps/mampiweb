We love designing and developing for the web. However, there are those rare times when even things that we are passionate about start to feel like hard work. It is for these times that we have recruited the smallest member of our team.

Named after a [popular United States soccer star](http://cloud.lacroixdesign.net/image/1P2q2o030G0V), Dempsey is tasked with keeping the workplace morale high. She often accomplishes this by launching herself into laps, engaging workers in playful activities or performing hilarious antics. While not condoned in some workplaces, Dempsey is also known to dish out quite gratuitous displays of affection.

In addition to keeping morale high, Dempsey fills her day by performing security detail and ensuring that office seating remains occupied if someone goes out to make a coffee. In typical Don Draper-esque fashion, she is quite keen to take an office nap in order to keep the creative juices flowing.

We do not know how we got by before this rescued Schnauzer puppy joined us. Aside from piping in on the occasional phone call, most of Dempsey's contributions go unnoticed by those outside of our small design and development team. However, she has become integral part of our inner workings and we figured that it was about time to give credit where credit was due.
