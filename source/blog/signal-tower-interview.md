A little less that a year ago, I had the opportunity to sit down for an [interview](http://signaltower.co/james-lacroixs-path-to-becoming-a-designer/) with Sam Solomon. Sam runs a fantastic site, [Signal Tower](http://signaltower.co/), where he interviews various entrepreneurs. I recently realized that we had never shared this interview on the LaCroix Design Co. blog so with the recent launch of our new site, this seemed like the perfect time.

During the interview, Sam and I had the opportunity to discuss what led me into the field of design, why I started LaCroix Design Co. and my time spent being employed in the music industry. As a result, we also had the opportunity cover how that process affects my approach to design. The interview took place shortly after our launch of [1 Page Sites](http://www.1pagesites.net/), so we also talk about our package service for single page responsive sites.

Despite the unflattering still on the for the video placeholder, I had a wonderful time talking with Sam. If you are interested, you can view the entire interview [here](http://signaltower.co/james-lacroixs-path-to-becoming-a-designer/).
