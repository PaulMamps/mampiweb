In the [first post](/blog/new-adventures-in-collaboration-apps-services-part-1) of this series, I talked about the tools that we are regularly using for collaboration internally at [LaCroix Design Co.](/) and for external collaboration with our clients. The [second installment](/blog/new-adventures-in-collaboration-apps-services-part-2) delved into the services and applications that facilitate the collaborative iteration in our design process. We see our process as one that is evolving and ever improving. Therefore, this third and final post on our collaborative tools will focus on tools that we have recently implemented into our routine. Since we are always experimenting, this is far from exhaustive. Rather, it represents tools that we expect to remain in our arsenal for some time.

**ÜberConference** &mdash; *<a href="http://www.uberconference.com" target="_blank">UberConference.com</a>*  
Unexpected phone calls are a disruptive part of the workday. Most often, we are focused on the the projects that we are creating for our clients and are not at a point that would accommodate breaking away. In order to keep an uninterrupted workflow, we schedule phone conversations with clients in advance much like we would schedule a physical meeting. This allows us to set aside whatever we are working on to give full attention to communicating with the client.

Most likely when we're collaborating with a client, there are several members of their team that are involved in the process. Therefore, we like to include everyone involved as often as possible so that decisions made are best for the final outcome of the project. Often, this involves conference calls. Having multiple people on a call can sometimes be chaotic. Also, it is difficult to follow who you are talking with unless you are very familiar with the sound of their voice.

ÜberConference has been able to solve a number of these problems for us. The service lets us schedule call with our clients and sends out a reminder prior to the call. Users can call into the conference line by phone, the iOS application or by using a Chrome browser window. Online, it has a visual interface that highlights who is speaking so that we are able to know who we should be responding to. If the users have set up a profile, it also displays a profile image which makes the experience a bit more personal.

Although these features will not replace the experience of being in the same room with our clients, they do greatly improve upon the conference call experience. By removing some the confusion and distraction, phone meetings end with better understanding. Additionally, ÜberConference allows for us to make a recording of the phone call. Once the call is complete, we receive an email documenting who was on the call, the duration, who talked the most and who talked the least.

**Harvest** &mdash; *<a href="http://www.getharvest.com" target="_blank">GetHarvest.com</a>*  
After quite a bit of research, we have switched our system for invoicing this year. While, invoicing is often not a collaborative effort, tracking the time invested in each project is. Most of our projects are not based on an hourly rate but rather a proposal of cost and services to align with a client's budget. Tracking time on these projects allows us to assess the time spent on each completed project. These assessments help us to better predict what features and services can be accomplished within the budgets of future projects.

Harvest makes tracking time fantastically simple whether it is done through the web interface, iOS application or native OS X application. Most importantly, a Chrome extension allows for time to be tracked directly from Basecamp tasks. Thus, it fits perfectly into our existing collaboration process. Since the service is web based, both Michael and I are able to record the time associated to each completed task.

In addition to being able to easily track time, Harvest allows us to add expenses, with attached receipts, to internal and external projects. Since we work virtually with a great majority of our clients, Harvest further compliments our process by providing a link on each invoice which allows for clients to pay for their invoice online. Great efficiency in our administration tasks grants us more time to creatively solve our clients' design problems.
