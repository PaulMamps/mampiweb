The <a href="http://2013.dishconference.com" target="_blank">DISH 2013 Student Design Conference</a> kicks off this Friday, February 22, 2013 with keynote speaker, <a href="http://tanamachistudio.com" target="_blank">Dana Tanamachi</a>. The annual two day conference was always one my favorite events to coordinate during my time serving on the <a href="http://nashville.aiga.org" target="_blank">AIGA Nashville</a> board. This year, we once again had the opportunity to create the website for the event. You can read more about the new responsive website here. If you are a student in the Nashville area, then I highly recommend that you register for this event at <a href="http://2013.dishconference.com" target="_blank">DishConference.com</a>.
