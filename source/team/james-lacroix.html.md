It was relentless curiosity that led James into the field of design. Never content with doing just one thing, he sought to find answers to those pesky "why" and "how" questions in life. He spent his youth passing between disciplines as they became too familiar.

After serving as creative director and founding member of a couple of branding/merchandising companies, he began LaCroix Design Co. in the fall of 2005. The studio provides an environment where curiosity leads to exploration, iteration and execution. It is in this environment that the goals of clients are examined and solutions are crafted to reach them.

Being a designer is not just a career, but a way of life. James thoroughly enjoys learning about the trade of his clients and is constantly in search of ways to create better experiences. While serving as an adjunct professor of design at <a href="http://www.lipscomb.edu/" target="_blank">Lipscomb University</a>, James had the opportunity to encourage students to ask the  "why" and "how" questions while developing the skills of a designer. He also had the fortune to serve the design community on a larger level through his term as chapter president of <a href="http://nashville.aiga.org/" target="_blank">AIGA Nashville</a> and through various speaking engagements.
